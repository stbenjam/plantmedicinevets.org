        Plant medicines (also known as Entheogens) are naturally occurring plants and fungi that contain nonaddictive psychoactive
        molecules. They have been used by humans for their spiritual and medicinal
        purposes since as far back as 11,000 BC in Northern Africa and 3,000 BC in the Americas. The Nixon
        Administration classified entheogens as Schedule I drugs through the Federal Controlled Substances Act
        without scientific basis. Top Nixon Aide, John Ehrlichman, admitted that these Schedule I classifications,
        including cannabis, were done to purposefully criminalize Black Americans and people protesting the
        Vietnam War.

                millions of dollars in Medicaid expenses every year.

        veterans who could benefit from plant medicines are not familiar with them. Unfortunately,
        corporations are taking advantage of these old drug laws to try to “legalize” these alternatives in a way
